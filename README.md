Code quiz 
I decided to create a quiz that accepts user in put and is timed.
I chose a black history theme for the first quiz and a food theme for a second quiz.
Each question was timed, time can be penalized for wrong answer.
This was a first in using two js files. One for the basic functionality of the page, buttons, timers, etc, the second was for the questions being asked and user esponse.
